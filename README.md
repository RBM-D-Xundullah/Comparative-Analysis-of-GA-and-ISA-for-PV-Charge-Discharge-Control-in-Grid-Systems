# Comparative-Analysis-of-GA-and-ISA-for-PV-Charge-Discharge-Control-in-Grid-Systems
The Enhanced Adaptive Heuristic Search Algorithm (EAHSA) is an optimization method used in the above project for charge/discharge control in grid systems with photovoltaic (PV) power. The EAHSA aims to find the optimal charge/discharge actions for each time step to minimize the difference between actual and predicted grid demand.

This script defines both the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the innovative stochastic algorithm, applying them to the provided dataset. The performance of both algorithms is compared by plotting their best fitness values against the number of iterations.
