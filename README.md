# Comparative-Analysis-of-GA-and-ISA-for-PV-Charge-Discharge-Control-in-Grid-Systems
The Enhanced Adaptive Heuristic Search Algorithm (EAHSA) is an optimization method used in the above project for charge/discharge control in grid systems with photovoltaic (PV) power. The EAHSA aims to find the optimal charge/discharge actions for each time step to minimize the difference between actual and predicted grid demand.
